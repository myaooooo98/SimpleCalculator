# Simple Calculator

This is a simple web-based application that performs basic mathematical operations. It provides an intuitive user interface to input numbers and perform calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The calculator can be used with both button and keyboard inputs.

**[Live Demo](https://myaooooo98.github.io/SimpleCalculator/)**

## Features
- Addition: add two numbers together.
- Subtraction: subtract one number from another.
- Multiplication: multiply two numbers.
- Division: divide one number by another.
- Percentage Calculations: perform calculation involving percentage.
- Continuation of operations: ability to continue with operations with the same operator and second operand after the first calculation.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Getting Started
To use the calculator application, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
```
git clone git@github.com:myaooooo98/SimpleCalculator.git
```
2. Open the **index.html** file in web browser.

Alternatively, you can directly access the [Live Demo](https://myaooooo98.github.io/SimpleCalculator/) of the calculator.
  
## Usage
To use the calculator, it must consists first operand, operator and second operand.
```
      1              +              2
(first operand)  (operator)  (second operand)
```

- Enter the number using number buttons or numeric keys on your keyboard.
- Use the **plus-minus (+/-)** button to change the number into negative number and vice versa.
- Select desired operation (+, -, ×, ÷) using the corresponding buttons or corresponding keys.
- Press '=' button or 'Enter' key to perform the calculation
- Click 'CE' button or 'Backspace' key to delete the number or operator.
- Use 'AC' button or 'Escape' key to reset the calculator.

### Continuation of Operations
- After performing the first calculation, press Equal button to continue with the operation where the second operand and operator are the same as the previous operation. The first operand will be the answer from previous operation.
- If Equal button is clicked before entering the second operand, the first number will automatically become the second operand.
- If operator buttons or keys are inputted after operation is completed, the answer from previous operation will become the first operand for the new operation.

## Disclosure
This project is based on the tutorial from FreeCodeCamp titled **["How to Build an HTML Calculator App from Scratch Using JavaScript"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-an-html-calculator-app-from-scratch-using-javascript-4454b8714b98/)**. The tutorial provided valuable guidance and insights for developing this calculator application. The additional features, including percentage calculations, plus-minus converter, delete feature, and previous operations display, were implemented by myself to enhance the calculator's functionality.
